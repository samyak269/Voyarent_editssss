          Reviews from your visitors are the most effective way to promote your business. It's also an easy way to build trust with your customers. Good reviews from your visitors promote and advertise your business in the best way. Their opinions and impressions have the power to positively or negatively affect your future travelers. It's like advertising as it used to be word of mouth. At the end of the trip, we will ask your travelers to leave a review and share their sailing experience with other people. Your travelers can describe and evaluate your boat, the service staff, the cleanliness, the destinations they visited and the overall quality of their trip. As an owner you have the opportunity to respond to your visitors' comments. You, in turn, can evaluate their behavior and leave your comments. Your impressions of your guests will help other owners in the future to reach out and communicate better with their next guests. For you, your customers' feedback is the motivation to improve and correct any omissions that you have not noticed until now.
