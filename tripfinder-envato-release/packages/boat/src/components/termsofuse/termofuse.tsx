        <Text className="mt-2 text-sm lg:mt-3">
        The purpose of Voyarent is to provide its users services with clear terms that help those involved (users, owners, managers, travelers, renters, customers) to get in touch and trade-in comfortably and securely.  The website allows all yacht owners and operators to display their yachts to the general public to obtain bookings for yacht charters or short-sea excursions/cruises. They can enter information with their own rental terms and list the services they offer.
        <br></br>
 By following the guidelines set by the boat owners, Voyarent ensures a fair and transparent platform that respects the preferences and requirements of both owners and renters.
 <br></br>
Voyarent acts as an intermediary, is not a party to the final agreement, nor it is involved in the provision of charter services. Voyarent is not responsible and does not apologize for omissions, poor quality services or non-performance of services by the owner regarding the reservation. 
<br></br>
The primary responsibility of the company is to ensure the efficient management of reservations following the terms of use of the platform. However, it is important to note that if the owner of the boat has posted specific terms and conditions for rental on the platform, they hold greater significance and override the rules established by Voyarent. In this regard, Voyarent adheres to the payment and cancellation policies, as well as the travel rules selected and entered by the boat owners during the registration process on the website. These policies and rules, determined by the owners themselves, dictate the terms under which the reservation is made and subsequently managed.  Overall, the responsibility of the company lies in effectively managing the reservations in line with the platform's terms of use, while acknowledging and prioritizing any specific terms outlined by the boat owners themselves.
The company's liability is limited to the online financial management of the reservation. Full responsibility for the proper execution of the reservation services lies solely with the shipowner who is the provider of the cruise services. The company is not responsible for inaccurate or incomplete information entered by the shipowner or for updating the details of its registration. 
<br></br>
The company is not responsible for misconducts caused by any parties involved (including the owner, client or third parties) and is relieved of any moral, material or other liability. In the event that an act of a criminal or civil crime is committed during the trip by the user himself or any third party, the company bears no responsibility as it only manages the financial part of the reservation, as stated in these terms of use. The company is not legally liable to users for any form of damage suffered by the respective user who on their own initiative and with the knowledge of the platform’s terms proceeds to use it
<br></br>
The company is responsible for the online financial management of the reservation in accordance with the terms of use of the platform and adheres to the payment and cancellation policy  and travel rules chosen and registered by the owners on the website during the registration process of their boat.
<br></br>
Financial management means the electronic collection  of the value of the reservation  by the traveler and  pay out of this amount (less the platform service fees) to the owner after the reservation is completed.
<br></br>
After the reservation acceptance by the shipowner and completion of the agreement, the company manages and validates the reservation. Through the automated system, the rental amount is collected from the traveler and the payment and reservation details are sent to the owner, while at the same time the dates for the availability of the boat are binded. At the same time the system sends to the traveler the confirmation with the details of the reservation and the payment. The total value of the reservation includes the value of the overnight stays, the crew's fees the cleaning fees and the platform services.
24 hours after the end of the reservation (check out date stated in the reservation details) and if there is no valid and proven dispute by travelers, the payment process to the owner begins immediately.
<br></br>
The company reserves the right to temporarily suspend its operation due to failure of communication networks or for reasons of maintenance or upgrade of the website.
<br></br>
The company reserves the right to suspend a Voyarent user account if it deems that the user does not meet or comply with these terms of use.
For the safety of the members, the company verifies and identifies their details with the registration (telephone number, e-mail address, VAT, Tax Office, and IDENTITY OR PASSPORT NUMBER).
<br></br>
In case of cancellation of the reservation, the article CANCELLATION OF RESERVATION-REFUNDS and CANCELLATION POLICY  shall be observed.
<br></br>
 Voyarent controls but is not responsible and does not apologize for the content published by the users of the website.
 <br></br>
 Voyarent is not responsible for the tax obligations of the users. It is not responsible if the boat has a difference in relation to the registration.
 <br></br>
The company is not responsible if a third party or user illegally invades the website or the service in order to cause damage.
