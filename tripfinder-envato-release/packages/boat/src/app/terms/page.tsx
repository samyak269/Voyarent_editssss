              The purpose of Voyarent is to provide its users services with clear terms that help those involved (users, owners, managers, travelers, renters, customers) to get in touch and trade-in comfortably and securely.  The website allows all yacht owners and operators to display their yachts to the general public to obtain bookings for yacht charters or short-sea excursions/cruises. They can enter information with their own rental terms and list the services they offer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className='text-xl'>
              By following the guidelines set by the boat owners, Voyarent ensures a fair and transparent platform that respects the preferences and requirements of both owners and renters.

              Voyarent acts as an intermediary, is not a party to the final agreement, nor it is involved in the provision of charter services. Voyarent is not responsible and does not apologize for omissions, poor quality services or non-performance of services by the owner regarding the reservation.

              The primary responsibility of the company is to ensure the efficient management of reservations following the terms of use of the platform. However, it is important to note that if the owner of the boat has posted specific terms and conditions for rental on the platform, they hold greater significance and override the rules established by Voyarent. In this regard, Voyarent adheres to the payment and cancellation policies, as well as the travel rules selected and entered by the boat owners during the registration process on the website. These policies and rules, determined by the owners themselves, dictate the terms under which the reservation is made and subsequently managed.  Overall, the responsibility of the company lies in effectively managing the reservations in line with the platform's terms of use, while acknowledging and prioritizing any specific terms outlined by the boat owners themselves.

Full responsibility for the proper execution of the reservation services lies solely with the shipowner who is the provider of the cruise services.

The company is not legally liable to users for any form of damage suffered by the respective user who on their own initiative and with the knowledge of the platform’s terms proceeds to use it
