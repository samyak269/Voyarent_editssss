  description:
    "Do not miss the opportunity to board this magnificent oceanis 35. Finot-Conq's sharp-edged boat hull and the slightly displaced mast will offer you great balance and comfort on the one hand, and on the other excellent performance and great stability in navigation. The large space inside, consisting of a fitted kitchen, three double cabins and a bathroom with shower will ensure you maximum comfort while the two helm stations and the wide stern platform from which you can dive into the crystal clear waters of sardinia will simplify the conduct of the boat and facilitate the descent into the sea. Come and discover capo san marco, a promontory in the southern part of the sinis peninsula that can be reached in just 40 minutes by boat or take this opportunity to visit an ancient settlement such as a phoenician city founded in the 8th century BC. Furthermore, about 14 nautical miles from the tourist port of oristano, there is also mal di Ventre, in Sardinian Malu Etna, a small island facing the coast.",
